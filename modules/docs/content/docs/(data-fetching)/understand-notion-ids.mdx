To fetch content from a Notion page using the Notion API, you need to know the page ID or database ID of the page or
database you want to access. And sometimes you may also need to know the block ID of a specific block inside a page.

## Finding Notion IDs

Notion IDs are unique identifiers for pages, databases, and blocks within Notion. They are typically represented as a
string of alphanumeric characters separated by hyphens. Here's how you can find these IDs:

### Page ID

To find the Page ID of a Notion page, follow these steps:

1. Open the Notion page in your web browser.
2. Look at the URL in the address bar. The URL will look something like this:
   `https://www.notion.so/your-workspace/your-title-8b3ds73349924972a2677f874ee33cdc`
3. The Page ID is the last part of the URL after the last hyphen. In this example, the Page ID is
   `8b3ds73349924972a2677f874ee33cdc`.

### Database ID

To find the Database ID of a Notion database, follow these steps:

1. Open the Notion database in your web browser.
2. Look at the URL in the address bar. The URL will look something like this:
   `https://www.notion.so/your-workspace/your-database-title-3f5g6h7j8k9l0m1n2o3p4q5r6s7t8u9v0`
3. The Database ID is the last part of the URL after the last hyphen. In this example, the Database ID is
   `3f5g6h7j8k9l0m1n2o3p4q5r6s7t8u9v0`.

### Block ID

To find the Block ID of a specific block within a Notion page, follow these steps:

1. Open the Notion page containing the block in your web browser.
2. Right-click on the block you want to find the ID for and select "Copy link" from the context menu.
3. Paste the copied link into a text editor. The link will look something like this:
   `https://www.notion.so/your-workspace/your-title-8b3ds73349924972a2677f874ee33cdc?pvs=4#b1c2d3e4f5g6h7i8j90k1l2m3n4o5p6`
4. The Block ID is the part of the URL after the `#` symbol. In this example, the Block ID is
   `b1c2d3e4f5g6h7i8j90k1l2m3n4o5p6`.
