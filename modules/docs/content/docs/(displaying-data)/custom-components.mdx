description: How to use custom components to render Notion data
---

If you want to customize the rendering of the blocks or if you want to use a block variant which is currently not supported
by the `@wanner.work/notion` package, you can pass a custom block component per variant to the `Notion` component.

## Configuration file

For this, it is recommended to create a config file where you define all your custom components and then import
that config file wherever you use the `Notion` component.

```tsx title="notion.config.tsx"
import { NotionRenderConfig } from "@wanner.work";

export default {
  blocks: [],
  hideUnsupportedBlockWarning: false
} satisfies NotionRenderConfig
```

## Custom block components

<Callout type="info" title="Custom File">
  Although you can define your custom block components directly in the config file, it is recommended
  to create a separate file for each component for better maintainability.
</Callout>

After creating the config file, create a custom block component for each block variant you want to customize.

```tsx title="NotionCalloutBlock.tsx"
import { CalloutBlockObjectResponse } from '@notionhq/client'
import { NotionBlockObject, NotionRichText } from '@wanner.work/notion'

export default function NotionCalloutBlock({
  block,
}: Readonly<NotionBlockObject<CalloutBlockObjectResponse>>) {
  return (
    <div className="mb-5 mt-6 rounded-xl bg-neutral-100 px-6 py-4 font-light text-black">
      <NotionRichText rich_text={block.callout.rich_text} />
    </div>
  )
}

```

Then, import the custom block component in your config file and add it to the `blocks` array.

```tsx title="notion.config.tsx"
import { NotionRenderConfig } from "@wanner.work";
import NotionCalloutBlock from "./NotionCalloutBlock";

export default {
  blocks: [
    {
      type: "callout",
      component: NotionCalloutBlock
    }
  ]
} satisfies NotionRenderConfig
```

## Using the config file

Finally, import the config file wherever you use the `Notion` or `NotionBlock` component and pass it to the `config` prop.

```tsx
import Notion from "@wanner.work/notion";
import notionConfig from "./notion.config";

export default function Application() {
  // data is the transformed data from the notion API

  return (
    <Notion
      data={data}
      config={notionConfig}
    />
  )
}
```

<Callout type="info" title="Why not a context?">
  You might wonder why the config is passed via props instead of using a React context. The reason is that using context would
  break server-side rendering and static site generation, as the context would not be available during the initial render on the server.
</Callout>
