## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

### 1. React Application

You need to have a React application set up.

<Callout title="Important" type="warning">
  While this package works on both client and server side, the request to Notion's API has to be made from
  the server. Make sure to have your React application set up where you can make server side requests or provide
  the necessary API routes.
</Callout>

### 2. Notion Integration and a Notion page

Create a Notion integration with read access to a Notion page by following the steps in the [Configure Notion](./getting-started/preparing-notion) guide.

## 3. Installation

After that, install the package using your preferred package manager:

```npm
npm i @wanner.work/notion
```

Now you are ready to use the package in your React application!
