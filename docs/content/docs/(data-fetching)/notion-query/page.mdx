## Using retrievePage

As already shown in the [Using NotionQuery](./index) section, you can easily query a Notion page using the `NotionQuery` class. Here is a quick example:

```tsx
import { NotionQuery } from '@wanner.work/notion'

const query = new NotionQuery(process.env.NOTION_SECRET)

const {
  page,
  data
} = await query.retrievePage('the-id-of-the-page')
```

This will return the transformed page data, which you can then use with the `Notion` component to render the content in your React application, as well as
the page information including properties.

## Using retrievePageInformation and retrievePageData

If you only need the page information or only the page data, you can also use the `retrievePageInformation` or `retrievePageData` methods respectively:

```tsx
import { NotionQuery } from '@wanner.work/notion'

const query = new NotionQuery(process.env.NOTION_SECRET)

const page = await query.retrievePageInformation('the-id-of-the-page')
const data = await query.retrievePageData('the-id-of-the-page')
```

The `retrievePage` method is just a convenient wrapper around these two methods to fetch both in one call and do it in parallel.
