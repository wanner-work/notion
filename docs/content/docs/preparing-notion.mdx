To be able to access pages inside a Notion workspace with this package, you need to do a few things to prepare Notion for that.

## Create an integration

First you need to create an integration with read access. You can do that by visiting this page.

      href="https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations"/>

## Enable the integration in your workspace

After creating the integration, you need to enable it in your workspace. You can do that by following these steps:

1. Open Notion and navigate to the top level page you want to use.
2. Click the `triple dot` menu in the top right corner.
3. Select `Connections` from the dropdown menu.
4. In the `Connections` modal, search for your integration and enable it.

Now your integration has access to the page and all its subpages. You can now use the page id to fetch the content from
the Notion API.
