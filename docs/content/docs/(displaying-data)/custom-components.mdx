description: How to use custom components to render Notion data
---

If you want to customize the rendering of the blocks or if you want to use a block variant which is currently not supported
by the `@wanner.work/notion` package, you can pass a custom block component per variant to the `Notion` component.

## Configuration file

For this, it is recommended to create a config file where you define all your custom components and then import
that config file wherever you use the `Notion` component.

```tsx title="notion.config.tsx"
import { NotionRenderConfig } from "@wanner.work";

export default {
  blocks: []
} satisfies NotionRenderConfig
```

## Custom block components

<Callout type="info" title="Custom File">
  Allthough you can define your custom block components directly in the config file, it is recommended
  to create a separate file for each component for better maintainability.
</Callout>

After creating the config file, create a custom block component for each block variant you want to customize.

```tsx title="NotionImageBlock.tsx"
import { NotionBlockProps } from "@wanner.work";
import { getNotionImageURL } from "@wanner.work/helper";
import { ImageBlockObjectResponse } from "@notionhq/client/build/src/api-endpoints";

function NotionImageBlock({
  block,
  level,
  children
}: NotionBlockProps<ImageBlockObjectResponse>) {
  return <img src={getNotionImageURL(block.image)} alt="test" />
}
```

Then, import the custom block component in your config file and add it to the `blocks` array.

```tsx title="notion.config.tsx"
import { NotionRenderConfig } from "@wanner.work";
import NotionImageBlock from "./NotionImageBlock";

export default {
  blocks: [
    {
      type: "image",
      component: NotionImageBlock
    }
  ]
} satisfies NotionRenderConfig
```

## Using the config file

Finally, import the config file wherever you use the `Notion` or `NotionBlock` component and pass it to the `config` prop.

```tsx
import Notion from "@wanner.work/notion";
import notionConfig from "./notion.config";

export default function Application() {
  // data is the transformed data from the notion API

  return (
    <Notion
      data={data}
      config={notionConfig}
    />
  )
}
```

<Callout type="info" title="Why not a context?">
  You might wonder why the config is passed via props instead of using a React context. The reason is that using context would
  break server-side rendering and static site generation, as the context would not be available during the initial render on the server.
</Callout>
