description: How to display Notion page content using the Notion component
---

The `Notion` component is the main component provided by this package to display
Notion page content in your React application. It takes the transformed Notion
data (which you can get using the `NotionQuery` class) and renders it using built-in
or configured components.

## Usage

### Using the `Notion` component:

```tsx
import Notion from '@wanner.work/notion'

export default function Application() {
  // get the data using one of the methods explained

  return <Notion data={data} />
}
```

### Using the `NotionBlock` component:

If you somehow need more flexibility, you can also just use `NotionBlock` components directly.

```tsx
import NotionBlock from '@wanner.work/notion'

export default function Application() {
  // get the data using one of the methods explained

  return data.map((object) => (
    <NotionBlock key={object.block.id}
      block={object.block}
      children={object.children}
      level={object.level}
    />
  ))
}
```

## Currently supported block components

The package comes with built-in block components for the following types:

- `paragraph`
- `heading_1`
- `heading_2`
- `heading_3`
- `audio`
- `image`

It is by design that the block components are kept minimalistic to allow you to
customize the rendering as you like. If you need more block types or want to
customize the rendering, please refer to the [Customizing the rendering](./custom-components) guide.
